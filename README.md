# Hobo & Hatch B2B Ordering Portal

* This ordering portal is created for the fourth and final project on the Full Stack Developer Diploma with Code Institute.  
* The project encompasses the languages and frameworks that I have been using throughout the course, and in particular HTML5, CSS3 & Javascript as frontend tools, using Bootstrap as a frontend framework.  The backend is created with Python, sqlite3 and Django and deployed on Heroku. 
* The project is based on a real life spec to design a wholesale ordering portal for retail & wholesale clothing and accessories brand Hobo & Hatch.  The project is delivered at this stage as an MVP, with future features and implementations expected in V2. 

## Strategy
------
* The User stories have been created having discussed in an initial meeting with the brand their requirements for the project.  
* The primary target audience for the brand at a retail / Ecommerce level are women in the 27 to 55 age range with free-spirited values.  They like their own spiritual / bohemian style, and are likely to prefer outdoorsy holidays and hobbies such as surfing and camping and as much travel as possible.  
* This will influence the design in terms of the surface of the website, as even though the website is B2B it is equally important that the brand ethos and look is conveyed to the store buyers.
